Android Location Tracking

This application is used to track user's location regularly in the background. It will work even if user quits it. It has a turn on/off function for user to stop it.

In this application I use Sevice, AlarmManager, Fragment, Content Provider and LoaderManager classess. The Fragment class requires support package, which could be downloaded using Android SDK manager.

I build it as a research tool; feel free to fork or use it.
